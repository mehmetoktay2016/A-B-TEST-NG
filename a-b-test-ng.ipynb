One of our clients, bombabomba.com, has decided to test this new feature and wants to conduct an A/B test to understand if average bidding brings more conversions than maximum bidding.\nIn this A/B test, bombabomba.com randomly splits its audience into two equally sized groups, e.g. the test and the control group. A Facebook ad campaign with “maximum bidding” is served to “control group” and another campaign with “average bidding” is served to the “test group”.\nThe A/B test has run for 1 month and bombabomba.com now expects you to analyze and present the results of this A/B test."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Facebook Ad: An advertisement created by a business on Facebook that's served up to Facebook users.\n- Impressions: The number of times an ad is displayed.\n- Reach: The number of unique people who saw an ad.\n- Website Clicks: The number of clicks on ad links directed to Advertiser’s website.

Can we conclude statistically significant results?\n- Two independent samples test results greater than 0.05 using test and control group data set H0 hypothesis cannot be rejected because of its outcome. In other words, the purchase made with the maximum bidding and average bidding methods It was observed that there was no significant difference between the averages of the intake.\n\n\n#3. Which statistical test did you use, and why?\n\n- Two independent sample T tests were used. The reason for this is to observe the effect of two different situations on our earnings.Normally, when we look at the mean of the two groups, there seemed to be a difference between the groups. But out of our generalization concern, we need to prove whether it happened by chance. Therefore, we made a statistical test.\n\n#4. Based on your answer to Question 2, what would be your recommendation to client?\n\n- When we look at these results, it is seen that normality and variance homogeneity are ensured. If these were not provided I was going to look for outliers, but since this is not the case, I cannot edit the data set. Therefore You can obtain healthier results by increasing the number of observations."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
